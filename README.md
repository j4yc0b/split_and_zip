This code can be used for zipping a .csv file and splitting the file in as many parts as determined by the maximum file size, as per the users' needs. User can run the code simply from the command line by placing the code into the same directory as the .csv file and providing as command line arguments the filename as well as the desired maximum file size (and the delimiter as optional argument).
